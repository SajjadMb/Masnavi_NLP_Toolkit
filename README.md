# Masnavi NLP Toolkit
In the following repository, I worked on one of the known Persian poetry literature named Masnavi. I used libraries such as Hazm and Parsivar, besides some snippets I wrote to preprocess text. Afterward, I used the Stanza framework in analyzing my code, and finally, using LDA and NMF models, I got the topic modeling based on each couplet in Masnavi.
